### [Presentation Deck]()



## Executive summary:
- What is your goal? The goal of this project is to provide accurate salary guidance to increase pay transparency for new job seekers.
- Where did you get your data?
- What are your metrics? The key metrics are RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
- What were your findings?
- What risks/limitations/assumptions affect these findings? 
The main assumption is that similar skilled candidates should be able to negotiate same salary range. However, there are many factors outside the scope of this project which have considerable impact on the salary range such as personality, negotiation skills and personal beliefs. 

### Introduction


### Problem Statement
1. Pay is one of the most important factors in considering a new job. Yet, only a small percentage of companies has explicitly state the salary range. The assymetric information could lead unoptimised outcome for job seeker and business. Moreover, the lack of transparency can amount to unintentional discrimination and inequality issues due to bias.
2. Evaluate your current salary and potential job offers compared to the job market.
3. Understand the value of each skills and possible career paths based on current position.
